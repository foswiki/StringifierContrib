---+ StringifierContrib
%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This extension has been extracted from Foswiki:Extensions/KinoSearchContrib to make it available
for search engines other than kinosearch.

%TOC%

---++ Supported file formats

   * =.txt=
   * =.html=
   * =.xml=
   * =.doc=
   * =.docx=
   * =.xls=
   * =.xlsx=
   * =.ppt=
   * =.pptx=
   * =.pdf=

You can change this with the
=$Foswiki::cfg{StringifierContrib}{IndexExtensions}= setting in =configure=.

If you add other file extensions, they are treated as ASCII files. If needed,
you can add more specialised stringifiers for further document types (see below).

---++ Backend for Indexing Word 2003 Documents

To index Word 2003 Documents (=.doc=) you will need to install one of the following:

   * =antiword= (recommended)
   * =abiword=
   * =wvWare=

You can then select the tool to use in =configure=.

---++ Backend for PDF

To index =.pdf= files you need to install =xpdf-utils=.

---++ Backend for PPT

To index =.ppt= files you need to install =ppthtml=.

---++ Backends for DOCX, PPTX

To index these file types, you will need to install the following tools from Sourceforge:
   * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt/][docx2txt]] for =.docx=
   * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pptx2txt/][pptx2txt]] for =.pptx=

Then set the command path to these tools in =configure=.

---++ Installing the Contrib

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Configuration

There are a number of settings that need to be set in =configure= before you can use the Contrib.

---++ Test of the Installation

   * Test if the installation was successful:
      * Check that =antiword=, =abiword= or =wvHtml= is in place: Type =antiword=,  =abiword= or =wvHtml= on the prompt and check that the command exists.
      * Check that =pdftotext= is in place: Type =pdftotext= on the prompt and check that the command exists.
      * Check that =ppthtml= is in place: Type =ppthtml= on the prompt and check that the command exists.
      * Change the working directory to the =kinosearch/bin= Foswiki installation directory.
      * Run =./kinoindex=
      * Once finished, open a browser window and point it to the =[[System.KinoSearch]]= topic.
      * Just type a query and check the results.

---++ Test of Stringification with =stringify=

Some users report problems with the stringification: The stringifier scipts
fails, takes too long on attachments. Some times this may result from
installation errors esp. of the installation of the backends for the
stringification.

=stringify= give you the opportunity to test the stringification in advance.

Usage: =stringify file_name=

In the result you see, which stringifier is used and the result of the
stringification.

Example:

<verbatim>
stringify /path/to/foswiki/StringifierContrib/test/unit/StringifierContrib/attachement_examples/Simple_example.doc

Simple example  

Keyword: dummy  

Umlaute: Grober, Uberschall, Anderung
</verbatim>

---++ Further Development

In this extension, a plug-in mechanism is implemented, so that additional
stringifiers can be added without changing the existing code. All stringifier
plugins are stored in the directory =lib/Foswiki/Contrib/StringifierContrib/Plugins=. 

You can add new stringifier plugins by just adding new files here. The minimum
things to be implemented are:

   * The plugin must inherit from =Foswiki::Contrib::StringififierContrib::Base=
   * The plugin must register itself by =__PACKAGE__->register_handler($application, $file_extension)=;
   * The plugin must implement the method =$text = stringForFile ($filename)=

All the stringifiers have unit tests associated with them, and we would
encourage you to provide unit tests for any you wish to contribute. See
Foswiki:Development/UnitTests for more information on unit testing.

See Foswiki:Tasks/StringifierContrib for currently open tasks.
